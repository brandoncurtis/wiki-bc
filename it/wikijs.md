# Shortcomings
These shortcomings apply to the particular release of wiki.js that I'm testing, v1.0.102.
From browsing the issues in GitHub, it looks like a wide range of improvements are planned for the upcoming v2.
This project is so cool that I would totally be down to contribute to it.

- linking facility is very simplistic
	- `ctrl-k` does work
	- linking with `()[/folder/page]` does work
- if the site is public by default, no way to restrict read access to a subset of pages
