<!-- SUBTITLE: a really cheap microcontroller with wifi -->

# ESP8266 Overview
- low-cost microcontroller
- wireless and TCP/IP server capabilities
- support for SPI
- onboard DAC (0-1V, 10 bits, single channel)
# Resources
These official docs are pretty great:

- reasonably comprehensive guide to selecting tools to work with the NodeMCU devboard

NodeMCU Uploader
- https://github.com/kmpm/nodemcu-uploader
- https://pydigger.com/pypi/nodemcu-uploader
- this tool allows you to write files to an ESP8266 devboard with NodeMCU firmware already installed
- https://www.esp8266.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=1203
	- this is the forum post where this uploader was announced
- https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?t=2929
	- the "Device not found" error can occur when you have non-NodeMCU firmware installed on the board

## Just Enough Lua

`~=` is the `not equals` operator
`--` starts comments
`--[ --]` delimit multiline comments

There is a pretty decent "lua users wiki":

## An HTTP Server

https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/master/en/modules/http/
- this module makes all of these HTTP serves possible

Several simple HTTP servers have been assembled for the NodeMCU firmware:
- https://github.com/borischernov/nodemcu_http_server
	- really simple; I had an easy time working with this
	- it does however return the client's port instead of its IP address
- https://github.com/wangzexi/NodeMCU-HTTP-Server
	- I haven't experimented with this one yet
- https://github.com/marcoskirsch/nodemcu-httpserver
	- I haven't experimented with this one yet
- https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp8266-web-server/
	- this example is super-broken, so don't use it!
